No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to a Dispute may be brought by either Party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.\n\n‍IF YOU’RE A U.S. OR CANADIAN RESIDENT YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING “AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE” WHICH CONTAINS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT:\n\nAgreement to Arbitrate.\n\nThe “Agreement to Arbitrate” includes all provisions following this heading, through and including the paragraph titled “Changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate.”\n\nOnly after engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution process set forth in these Terms, and only after those efforts fail to resolve the Dispute, then either Party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, subject to the terms of this Agreement to Arbitrate and the applicable arbitration rules.\n\nYou and Discord (collectively the “Parties”) agree that this Agreement to Arbitrate is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.\n\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including: (1) claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Agreement to Arbitrate or any prior agreement; (2) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate. This Agreement to Arbitrate supersedes any prior arbitration agreement between Discord and you.\n\nExcept as set forth in the paragraph below titled “Exceptions,” the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve: (1) all Disputes; (2) whether a claim is subject to arbitration; and (3) any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration provider rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a Party's failure to comply with this Agreement to Arbitrate or the Informal Dispute Resolution process.\n\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. In some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND DISCORD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n‍Arbitration Rules.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
