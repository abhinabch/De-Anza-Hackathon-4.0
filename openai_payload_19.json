Extract important clauses:\n\n Either Party may elect to have Disputes regarding whether a complaining Party has satisfied the Informal Dispute Resolution procedures set forth above resolved by a court as a precursor to arbitration; otherwise it shall be resolved in the arbitration.\n\nClass Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, UNLESS DISCORD AGREES OTHERWISE IN A SEPARATE WRITING, YOU AND DISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. Where Discord does consent to consolidation, consolidation may be allowed by agreement or where ordered by a Procedural or Threshold Arbitrator at ADR Services or NAM and you agree to accept such consolidation. In cases consolidated pursuant to this paragraph, the relief may cover the consolidated claims.\n\nIf the paragraph titled “Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver,” the paragraph titled “Mass Filings,” or ADR Service’s Mass Arbitration rules are  found unenforceable, then the “Agreement to Arbitrate” section will be null and void.  If any other provision is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of the applicable arbitration provider, then the balance of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\n\nThis subsection does not prevent you or Discord from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\nChanges to this Agreement to Arbitrate: Discord will provide 30 days’ notice of the date of any material changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed, regardless of when they accrued. If you consent to these terms on or before the 30th day or continue to use the site after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Discord does not have actual notice under the Informal Dispute Resolution process are subject to the revised clause. If you reject any such changes by opting out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but there shall be deemed to be no arbitration agreement between you and Discord and any prior existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes under a prior version of the Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply to claims not yet filed.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
