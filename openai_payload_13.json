Extract important clauses:\n\n For residents of the state of California, or Mass Arbitrations involving any residents of the state of California, the arbitration will be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/).  For residents of all states other than California, and Mass Arbitrations involving no residents of California, the arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\"NAM\") and resolved before a single arbitrator. For residents of all states other than California if, and only if, NAM is not available to arbitrate, the alternative arbitrator shall be ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/).\n\nExcept as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, NAM will administer any arbitration in accordance with the NAM “Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures,” “Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer,” and the “Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures” in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Department at commercial@namadr.com.\n\nExcept as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, ADR Services will administer any arbitration in accordance with the ADR Services Arbitration Rules and General Fee Schedule in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with ADR Services, including its rules regarding “Mass Arbitrations,” and excluding any rules permitting class or representative actions.  The applicable ADR Services rules and procedures are available at www.adrservices.com.\n\nIf the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Discord submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or applicable law requires otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either Party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which may be in-person, via videoconference, or via telephone conference. You and Discord agree that dispositive motions will be allowed in the arbitration.\n\n‍Arbitration Costs. ADR Services and NAM set forth fees for their services, which are available from each provider. If Discord is the Party initiating an arbitration against you, Discord will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you initiate an arbitration against Discord, costs will be determined in accordance with the Rules for the applicable arbitration provider, to the extent allowed by law.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
