Discord enables you to build meaningful connections around the joy of playing games through voice, video and text features. We’re happy you’re here.\n\nThese terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.\n\n‍IMPORTANT NOTE: The section titled “Settling Disputes Between You and Discord” contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver that applies to all U.S. or Canada-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.\n\nWhen we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Discord Inc., its subsidiaries, and its related companies.\n\nWhen we say “services” in these terms, we mean Discord’s services, apps, websites, and other products.\n\nWhen we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.\n\nWe also have a Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and other policies (as listed here or as otherwise made available to you) that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services. If you use our APIs, SDKs, or other developer services or software, Discord’s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use. Discord’s Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through Discord, and Discord’s Monetization Terms apply to any sales you make through Discord. By using Discord’s services, you agree to these terms.\n\nTogether, these rules make Discord possible, and they matter to us. If you believe others aren’t following them, please let us know by reporting it to us.\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nWe’re Discord! Discord Inc. is located at 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Discord Netherlands B.V.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
