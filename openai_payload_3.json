Extract important clauses:\n\n\n\nDiscord is designed to make communicating with the people you want to speak to as easy as possible. Posts appear in text channels in the order in which they’re made. Voice and video communication happens in real time. We may build features that help you create content, communicate with others, discover or access content or third-party services, or join conversations more easily, or may highlight content and activity available to you on Discord that might be of interest. This may include the ability for you, or other users, to connect a Discord account and communicate on and off Discord through third-party services (like in-game features). Our services may also include certain features and content that are provided or sponsored by others or that you can purchase from us or others (additional terms may apply). Learn more below about the content and software that may be in our services.\n\nDiscord is designed to integrate with your device to make it easy to share what you’re up to. When Discord is running, we may identify active games and other applications on your device to allow you to quickly call a friend while in a game, stream what you’re doing on your device, share your status (including what game you're playing or what song you’re listening to if you link a music account), and more. Sharing gameplay and other activity status is fundamental to the Discord experience. You can change your Settings at any time, and you’re in control of whether or not you connect other accounts to Discord.\n\nDiscord’s services may be personalized to each user based on a variety of factors, including their activity, preferences they identified in their Settings, and servers they belong to, so that you can see content and communities that may be of interest to you (such as features or activity on Discord, promotions from us, and sponsored content). You can control whether and to what extent Discord personalizes your experience in your Settings.\n\nDiscord also takes user safety seriously. We provide features and services that are designed to help keep users safe.  Certain features and settings may have different defaults depending on your age or where you live, and some may not be optional at all. We also provide tools and resources like Family Center and our Guardian’s Guide to help parents and guardians better understand how Discord works, how their teens may use Discord, and how they can develop collaborative approaches to build positive online behaviors. We also provide features to help make Discord more accessible as described here.\n\nWe’re actively developing new features and products to improve Discord. As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some places or for some users) if they no longer make sense from a business perspective or create risk for Discord, our users, or other third parties.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
