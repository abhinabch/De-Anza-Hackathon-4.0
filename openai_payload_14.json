Extract important clauses:\n\n In all arbitrations, unless otherwise required by law or the arbitration provider’s rules, you are responsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including attorney’s fees and expert witness costs.\n\nThe Parties agree that the arbitration provider has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under the applicable rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The Parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either Party to the fees imposed by an arbitration provider does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section while such challenge remains pending before the arbitration provider, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.\n\nOffer of Judgment. At least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any Party may serve an offer in writing upon the other Party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by the offering Party is not accepted by the other Party, and the other Party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other Party will not recover its post-offer costs and will pay the offering Party’s costs from the time of the offer.\n\nArbitration Decision. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nExcept as explicitly set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these terms, including any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of arbitration provider or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules and procedures for any frivolous claims, improper claims, or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a Party's failure to comply with this Agreement to Arbitrate or claims filed on behalf of a claimant who is not party to this agreement. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.\n\nArbitration Location.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
