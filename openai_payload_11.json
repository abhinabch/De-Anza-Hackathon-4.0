Extract important clauses:\n\n The Parties further agree that whether a complaining Party has satisfied the requirements of this Informal Dispute Resolution process, including whether a Written Notice was properly submitted or contained all required information, is an issue that can be decided by a court as a prerequisite to arbitration.\n\nIf you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement (“OCDS”) mechanism under DSA Article 21. Note that a submission via the OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting a Written Notice to disputes@discordapp.com, will not toll the applicable statutes of limitations or other deadlines.\n\nGoverning Law, Jurisdiction, Class Action Waiver and Time Limitation.\n\nEXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW:\n\nChoice of Law. These terms and all Disputes between you and Discord, whether in arbitration or court (if a Dispute is non-arbitrable under these terms for any other reason), shall be governed by the law of the United States and the laws of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions—in other words, any federal law or California law, including any conflict of law principle, that would provide for the application of the laws of another jurisdiction other than the United States or California shall not apply.\n\nVenue and Jurisdiction. By agreeing to these terms, you and Discord agree that to the extent any Dispute is not arbitrable—including any arbitration-related litigation, such as a motion to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on an arbitration award—the Dispute must be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction, federal or state (including small claims court), located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, and no other court. You and Discord consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over you by such courts with respect to any such Dispute.\n\nIf you are a consumer residing in the European Union, this clause and these terms in general do not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have under your local law, and all Disputes arising in connection with the services and/or these terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands or, if you are a consumer, to a court in your domicile if in an EU Member State.\n\nClass Action Waiver.  You agree that any Dispute between you and Discord that for any reason is not subject to the “Agreement to Arbitrate” section below may only be pursued by you on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, or representative action. To the extent a Dispute between you and Discord is subject to arbitration, the provisions set forth in the “Agreement to Arbitrate” apply, including those regarding class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims, and batching.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
