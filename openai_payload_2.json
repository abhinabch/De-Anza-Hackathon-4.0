Extract important clauses:\n\n is located at Schiphol Boulevard 195, 1118 BG Schiphol, Netherlands\n\nAGE REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS\n\nBy accessing our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country. Our services are not designed for nor directed towards users under the age of 13. We may take additional steps, including the use of third-party services, to determine whether you are old enough to create a Discord account or access certain features or spaces. By creating a Discord account or using our services, you accept and agree to be bound by these terms and represent that you have either reached the age of \"majority\" where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help and ask them to read these terms with you. We maintain a list of minimum ages around the world as a resource for you, but we aren’t able to guarantee that it is always accurate. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child (who must meet the minimum age for your country) to use the services, then you and the minor child accept and agree to be bound by these terms and are responsible for all use of the Discord account or services, including your child’s activity on the services and purchases made by them, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM US\n\nDiscord provides services that help you connect with other Discord users and communities. Discord users communicate primarily via “servers,” which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels. Text channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media. Voice channels allow users to communicate by voice and/or streaming video. Users can also communicate one-to-one using direct messages, or communicate with a limited number of users via group direct messages. We’re always evolving our services, and we may create other types of spaces in the future!\n\nUsers create servers, and users choose which servers to join and who their “friends” are. All users must follow our Community Guidelines and other policies, but in servers, the server owners and admins control the server permissions and additional rules, including establishing membership requirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the server. Server owners and admins also control whether to make their server available in Server Discovery, whether to publish their server invite link on public websites, whether to enable community growth and safety features, and whether to add bots or other apps. These permissions, like the size of a server, may change over time.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
