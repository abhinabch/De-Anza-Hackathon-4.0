Respond ONLY with valid JSON: {\"highlights\": [\"clause1\", \"clause2\", ...]}"},{"content":"This is part 18 of 22 of a Terms of Service. Extract important clauses:\n\n  For Mass Filings at ADR Services, the Parties also agree that after 10% of the total number of cases that are subject to the Mass Filings have been resolved, Discord and the remaining claimants shall participate in a mediation, and at the conclusion of that process, if the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Discord or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process.\n\n‍Opt-out. You can decline this Agreement to Arbitrate–and no other provision of these terms–by emailing an opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com within 30 days of September 29, 2025 or when you first register your Discord account, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, Discord also will not be bound by it and there shall be no arbitration agreement existing between you and Discord, whether under these or prior arbitration provisions.  If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes will not apply to claims not yet filed.  If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, you will not be opting out of any other provision of these terms and you agree to be bound by all other provisions of these terms, which shall remain in effect as allowable by law.\n\n‍Exceptions. You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify, exclusively in a small claims court in the United States on an individual basis for Disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing Party initially chose, and you and Discord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in that court. The small claims court, and not any arbitrator or arbitration provider, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve Disputes regarding whether a Dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court. Additionally, Disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration. Either Party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a Party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a Party’s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
