If Discord initiates arbitration, and for residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New Castle, Delaware, United States of America, unless you and Discord otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines, based on a written objection, that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any Party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue despite either Party’s initial selection. For any arbitration conducted, the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New Castle County, Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, the Parties hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. The Parties agree that arbitration may take place exclusively by video, where such arrangements are acceptable to the appointed arbitrator.\n\nMass Filings.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
