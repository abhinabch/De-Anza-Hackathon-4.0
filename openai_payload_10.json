If you have an issue with the services or Discord, you agree that you will reach out to us and use good faith efforts to settle the Dispute informally through negotiation before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires emailing disputes@discordapp.com a written notice (“Written Notice”) about your issue, which must include: (1) your name; (2) the email address or phone number associated with your Discord account; (3) a detailed description of the issue; and (4) how you’d like to resolve it. This notice must be provided on an individual basis and you, along with your counsel if you have one, must be available personally for a telephone or videoconference to resolve your claims, unless Discord states in writing that you are not personally required to attend.\n\nIf the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the Written Notice, you and Discord agree to resolve any remaining Dispute through further informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution provisions below.\n\nThis Informal Dispute Resolution process, including your personal participation in the meet and confer is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. You and Discord (the “Parties”) agree that any applicable statute of limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the Parties engage in this Informal Dispute Resolution process.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
