Extract important clauses:\n\n If Discord changes this Agreement to Arbitrate after the date you first accepted this agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Discord product(s) or services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com before the 30 day period expires.\n\nMore important stuff\nYou have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms. The term “including” as used in these terms means “including without limitation.”\n\nEntire agreement. These terms cover the entire agreement between you and Discord for your use of our services.\n\nAdditional terms. Where additional terms apply to our products or services, the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that product or service to the extent of any conflict with these terms. Additional information about our services is provided for users in Austria here.\n\nBug reporting. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please visit https://discord.com/security.\n\nExport Control. You agree to comply with all applicable import, export, and re-export control laws and restrictions, including but not limited to those of the European Union and its member states, the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), and will not use the services to cause a violation of such laws or regulations.

If you fail to follow these terms and we don’t immediately act, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future). If any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
