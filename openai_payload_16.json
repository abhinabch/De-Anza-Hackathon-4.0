Extract important clauses:\n\n\n\nFor arbitrations before NAM (or any substitute provider for NAM that is agreed upon by the Parties or appointed by a court, due to NAM’s unavailability for any reason), to increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Discord within reasonably close temporal proximity (\"Mass Filing\"), the Parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Agreement to Arbitrate, but no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the completion of the “Mediation Period” described below, and after a prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Discord and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules.  Notwithstanding the Section entitled “Arbitration Location,” for arbitrations subject to this “Mass Filings” Section, the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Discord, the arbitrator, and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
