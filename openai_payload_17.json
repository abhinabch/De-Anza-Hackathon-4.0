Extract important clauses:\n\n  Any disagreement between the Parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching, or whether any demands are properly brought and may be included in a batch, shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This \"Batch Arbitration\" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitation applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.\n\nFor arbitrations before NAM, the results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Discord and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results of the first batch are provided to the mediator, Discord, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Discord or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process (“Mass Arbitration Opt Out”) and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the Mass Arbitration Opt Out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Discord nor the remaining claimants decide to trigger the Mass Arbitration Opt Out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process.  Absent notice of a Mass Arbitration Opt Out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.\n\nArbitration Proceedings at ADR Services.  Except as set forth in this provision, the paragraphs in the “Mass Filings” provision shall not apply to arbitrations proceeding at ADR Services, which the Parties agree shall be governed by ADR Services Rules, including ADR Services’ rules applicable to “Mass Filings”.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
