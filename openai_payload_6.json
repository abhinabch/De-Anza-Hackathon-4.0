Extract important clauses:\n\n Discord doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by Discord users. We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot always prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that content. You may report content that you think violates any of our policies. We have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion.\n\nThird-party features and content. Our services may also contain links to or allow you to access third-party websites, features, apps, or other content. This may include sponsored content (like Quests or other sponsored formats). We are not responsible for the content or services available from these third parties.\n\nSOFTWARE IN DISCORD’S SERVICES\n\nLicense to our software. Some of our services allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our services.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services. You also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable law permits it.\n\nAlthough we are granting you this license, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in our software and services.\n\nOpen source. Some of Discord’s services include software subject to separate open source license terms, and your use of those services are subject to your compliance with those license terms, when applicable. We encourage you to review them, as some licenses may explicitly override these terms.\n\nThird-party services. Discord may allow you to access apps, bots, or other products, features, or services developed by third parties (“third-party services”). For example, third parties can build apps for content moderation or interactive games that server administrators can add to their servers on Discord, or that incorporate certain Discord-powered features or functions (such as messaging capabilities) into their services (such as games played off Discord). It’s your choice whether to use these third-party services and whether to participate in Discord servers or other spaces that incorporate them. You should review any terms and policies provided by the third parties before doing so as they govern your use of their services. While these third parties do need to follow all policies that apply to them (which may include these Terms, our Community Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, and Developer Policy), Discord is not responsible for any third-party services.","role":"user"}],"max_tokens":800,"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
